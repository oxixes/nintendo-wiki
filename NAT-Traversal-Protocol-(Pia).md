Up to Pia version 5.10, the protocol port was used to determine the message type.

| Protocol Port | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | [Probe request](#probe-request) |
| 2 | [Probe reply](#probe-reply) |
| 3 | [Dummy packet](#dummy-packet) |

In Pia version 5.11 and later, all packets are sent through port 0 and always contain the [NatProbeData](#natprobedata) structure.
