[[NEX Protocols]] > Match Making Types
---

Since the match making methods are split across several protocols, this page documents all match making related structures in one place.

## Gathering ([Structure])
| Type | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Uint32 | m_idMyself |
| [PID] | m_pidOwner |
| [PID] | m_pidHost |
| Uint16 | m_uiMinParticipants |

| Uint32 | m_uiParticipationPolicy |
| Uint32 | m_uiPolicyArgument |
| Uint32 | [m_uiFlags](#flags) |
| Uint32 | m_uiState |
| [String] | m_strDescription |

### Flags
| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x10 | Controls what happens when the owner leaves the gathering. If set, the server chooses a new owner. If not set, the gathering is deleted. |

Many games also use flag 0x200, but its purpose is unknown.

## PersistentGathering ([Structure])
